          <h3 class="solar-blue">// About Me</h3>
          <span>
						Hey! Thanks for checking me out :)
						<br><br>
						I just recently graduated with honors from Northern Arizona University, where I majored in Computer Science 
						amd minored in Mathematics. I'm currently pursuing Software Engineering roles in several fields. I'm most experienced with 
						web development (both frontend and backend), but I've also had professional exposure to IoT 
						and low-level OS programming as a research assistant in several NAU labs. I enjoy web development, and would love to
						start my career as a full-stack or backend engineer, but I'm also open to other opportunities in different programmatic 
						contexts. Besides web development, I'm especially interested in Machine Learning and Blockchain technology. ML has 
						already revolutionized most fields, and it's become quite obvious that ML and AI will play a non-trivial role in informing us 
						on ways to stop and/or reverse many of the undesirable predicaments we find ourselves in today.
						<br><br>
						Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy a very active lifestyle. I'm most stoked on 
						adventurous multi-pitch and big-wall climbing these days, but I also love backpacking with my partner 
						and going on long solo runs. My dream job would be one where I work for a company whose products I already
						use, like Garmin, Strava, and OnX (just to name a few). I'm extremely passionate about working for a company that's
						exposed to the outdoor space, and I know I could make a meaningful impact at any one of them. I'm a bit of an "over-stoker" 
						when it comes to things I'm passionate about, and I would definitely bring this attitude to whichever team I join.
						<br><br>
						That's enough about me. If you still want to learn more, I'd happily tell you more over a cold ale at a hip microbrewery,
						or, better yet, over a smooshed PB&J after a long day of climbing.

						<!-- My grandpa was Bud Jordahl, a well-known conservationist, so conservation runs deep in my family. Because of 
						this, my goal is to work for a company who moves the needle towards a more sustainable future in any way. 
						I would love 
						to work for a company who is exposed to the outdoor space in some way, whether it be consumer utilities like Garmin, 
						Strava, or OnX, research, or 
						full-stack web development is what I'm most experienced with, but I've 
						also had professional exposure to IoT and low-level OS programming while working at several NAU labs. 
						I would love to dive deeper into full-stack development, but I also wouldn't mind learning and working 
						in a different programmatic context. 
						Ideally, I would be working for a company who is either exposed 
						to the outdoor industry (think Garmin, OnX, Strava, etc.), or similary involved in conserving or 
						improving the natural state of our precious blue dot. -->

					<span>
						While I completed dozens of cool projects at NAU, the following three contributed the most to my learning, 
						and were also the coolest. They are not in any particular order.

					<br><br>
					<h3 class="solar-yellow">1. pEEp Web Portal</h3>
					<span>
						For our senior capstone, our team was tasked with making an interactive web portal for a smart bird feeder. Over the course of two semesters,
						we went through the entire requirements acqusition process, iterated through alpha and beta prototypes, and completed extensive documentation.
						<br><br>
						Our end product was a full-fledged web application (based on Flask) that included a public community forum, profile systems, and
						image storage and management utilities. This project taught me how powerful a web framework like Flask could be, and opened my eyes to 
						my potential as a backend or full stack developer. What the UI lacks in luster, our clean backend more than makes up for.

					<h3 class="solar-yellow">2. Multiprocessing Operating System Simulator</h3>
					<span>
						This was one of the largest and most involved projects I worked on during my undergrad. Throughout the semester, we worked to create a Multiprocessing
						Operating System Simulator. After four phases that each built on eachother, I had thousands of lines of code split between a dozen seperate libraries
						and a simulator that ran processes according to a parameterizable scheduling scheme. The first phase had two main objectives: first, we had to code a
						parser that could scan configuration files and set simulator parameters, and second, we had to save the program files into meaningful data structures for 
						later use. In the second phase, we implemented the "first-come, first-serve" and "shortest job first" scheduling schemes to batch process the program files - 
						this was the first time our sim actually worked as a crude OS. 
						During the third phase, we implemented virtual memory management and ensured that each process could be allotted sufficient memory, and also ensured each process subsequently 
						relinquished that memory back to the OS after it had finished. In the fourth and final phase, we implemented preemptive scheduling for the schemes that we had coded during 
						phase 2 ( "shortest job first" and "first-come first-serve"), while also providing support for "round robin" scheduling. In the end, we were left with a simulator 
						that could run a set of processes according to 5 different scheduling schemes, half of which used POSIX threads and simulated interrupts for multiprocessing.

					<h3 class="solar-yellow">3. Recursive Ray Tracer</h3>
					<span>
						This was by far my favorite project of all time, because, for the first time, it really felt like our code was coming to life. We started with a simple raycaster
						that supported planes and spheres, but then extended this into a full blown raytracer by implementing lighting, reflectivity, and textures. As you can see, we 
						definitely had some fun with our test files. This entire project was done in C, which forced us to handle all the raw pixel manipulation on our own and taught us 
						a significant amount about low-level computer graphics.
