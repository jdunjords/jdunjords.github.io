						Hey! Thanks for checking me out :)
						<br><br>
						I just recently received my BS in Computer Science from Northern Arizona University,
						and am actively pursuing software engineering jobs in several fields. Out of all areas that I've studied, 
						full-stack web development is what I'm most experienced with, but I've also had professional exposure 
						to IoT and low-level OS programming while working at several NAU labs. I would love to dive deeper into full-stack 
						development, but I also wouldn't mind learning and working in a different programmatic context. Ideally, I would
						be working for a company who is either exposed to the outdoor industry (think Garmin, OnX, Strava, etc.), 
						or similary involved in conserving or improving the natural state of our precious blue dot.
						<br><br>
						You probably learned about my professional experience in my cover letter and resume, so I'll fill in some holes about
						the rest of my life with a wordy bulleted list:
						<br><br>
						<ul class="list-indent">
							<li>
								I love being in nature, and getting outdoors for extended periods of time will always be a priority of mine for many reasons.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								I'm totally hooked on climbing right now, especially adventurous multi-pitch and big-wall climbing. It's such an intense way
								 to interact with nature, and the partnerships I've made with others through this activity have proven to be deep and everlasting.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								I've lived in Flagstaff, AZ for nearly 4 years, and would love to stay a little longer if I can make it work professionally.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								I moved from California to Wisconsin when I was 9, and lived just north of Madison Until I was 19. Before you ask, the answer is no, I'm not
								much of a cheesehead.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								I have one older sister who is a mega-badass environmental policy analyst. 
								She went to George Washington University in D.C. for her undergrad, and just recently received her MPA from UW Seattle.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								I'm a huge animal lover. For this and other environmental reasons, I subsist on a mostly plant-based diet.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								While I haven't run much recently, I do like to go the distance. I ran a 50 mile ultramarathon in 2020,
								and my stoke to run long has finally returned after pacing my partner through her first 100-miler in June.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								My partner! Her name is Jen and I've been with her for just over 4 years. She's been my rock, and is constantly changing high-schooler's lives as an 
								English teacher (writing teacher, to be specific) back in Wisconsin.
							</li>
							<br>
						</ul>
						<br>

						That's bit of a scattered bio, but you get the picture. I'd be happy to tell you more over a good ale at some hipster microbrewery, but I'd much prefer a 
						luke-warm can-of-whatever after climbing a few pitches.

						While I completed dozens of cool projects at NAU, the following three contributed the most to my learning, \

					<br><br>\
					<h3 class="solar-yellow">1. pEEp Web Portal</h3>\
					<span>\
					  For our senior capstone, our team was tasked with making an interactive web portal for a smart bird feeder. Over the course of two semesters,\
						we went through the entire requirements acqusition process, iterated through alpha and beta prototypes, and completed extensive documentation.\
						<br><br>\
						Our end product was a full fledged Flask web application (written in Python) that included a public community forum, profile systems, and\
						image storage and management utilities. This project taught me how powerful a web framework like Flask could be, and opened my eyes to \
						my potential as a backend or full stack developer. What the UI lacks in luster, our clean backend more than makes up for.\

					<h3 class="solar-yellow">2. Multiprocessing Operating System Simulator</h3>\
					<span>\
						This was one of the largest and most involved projects I worked on during my undergrad. Throughout the semester, we worked to create a Multiprocessing\
						Operating System Simulator. After four phases that each built on eachother, I had thousands of lines of code split between a dozen seperate libraries\
						and a simulator that ran processes according to a parameterizable scheduling scheme. The first phase had two main objectives. Namely, we had to code a\
						parser that could scan configuration files and set simulator parameters, and second, we had to save the program files into meaningful data structures for \
						later use. In the second phase, we implemented the "first-come, first-serve" and "shortest job first" scheduling schemes to batch process the programs. \
						During the third phase, we implemented virtual memory management and ensured that each process had enough memory to do its job and subsequently \
						relinquished that memory back to the OS. In the fourth and final phase, we implemented pre-emptive scheduling for the schemes that we had coded during \
						phase 2 ( "shortest job first" and "first-come first-serve"), while also providing support for "round robin" scheduling.\

					<h3 class="solar-yellow">3. Recursive Ray Tracer</h3>\
					<span>\
						This was by far my favorite project of all time, because, for the first time, it really felt like our code was coming to life. We started with a simple raycaster\
						that supported planes and spheres, but then extended this into a full blown raytracer by implementing lighting, reflectivity, and textures. As you can see, we \
						definitely had some fun with our test files.\
